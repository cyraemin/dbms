# Database & SQL Basics

This repository contains my study notes and practice on
database fundamentals and basic SQL concepts.

So far, I have covered:
- What is a database
- RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Database structure (database, schema, table)
- Basic SQL CRUD operations

The notes are written in a simple, beginner-friendly way
for learning and quick revision.

I will keep updating this repository as I complete
more topics in databases and SQL.
